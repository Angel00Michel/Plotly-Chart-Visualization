# Description
We as Roza's volunteers were sent out on a hunt of a lifetime! We were given an objective to identify the top 10 bacterial species in people's belly buttons. So, if "Improbable Beef" (a synthetic beef company) identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture this synthetic beef, we as Roza's blessed volunteers; should be able to examine whether a species can be found in someone navel canal or not. We used JavaScirpt to create an in depth dashboard, which allows us to filter each volunteer into each given scenario. This visualization gives us an accurate representation as for how we could determine the impact this has to each individual. Tableua could also be used to show the results, but to run the actual analysis it would be best to use JavaScript and JSON file synonymously; making adapations for each given outcome.
